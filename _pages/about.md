Thanks for checking out my personal site! Here you'll find a little about myself and professional experience, educational papers, and some technical posts on various engineering topics such as Web Development, Machine Learning and AI, and possibly some ramblings of a coffee deprived engineer. 

Please feel free to contact me using the links provided in the profile section!

About Me
======
I was born and raised in the heat of Arizona and recently graduated with a Master's Degree in Software Engineering from Arizona State University. In 7th grade, I took an introduction to computers class and learned how to add and remove hardware from a desktop. The rest is history (Thanks, Mr. Harold).

Developing Software takes up most of my time, outside of that I love to listen to music, play guitar, and hang out with my friends and family.

Over the past few years, I've found myself passionately engaged in a variety of projects which include being the Technical Director for TEDxASU in pursuit of embracing continuous learning and spreading ideas.

In addition, I am also designing a cross-platform education application, launching later this year. My goal is to help students get organized while supplying supplemental learning material from around the web.
